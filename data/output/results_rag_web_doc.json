    "query": "Summarize the article in less than 200 words?",
    "answer": "The article investigates racial segregation in private schools, specifically Amite School Center (ASC) in Louisiana. The school's superintendent claims that racial segregation is not their goal, but concerns arise when only one Black player is seen on the school team. The article highlights the lack of diversity among school board members and staff, with only one Black trustee and no apparent Black representation among principals or officials collecting admission fees. Despite repeated attempts to contact the board members, none responded. This raises questions about the school's commitment to inclusivity and whether it is inadvertently perpetuating segregation."
